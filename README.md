### How to run the app

Make sure you are [running the express backend for this app](https://github.com/Vetrano89/item-list-example-express).

Probably not necessary to change but this is what I'm currently running:\
Npm version: v6.14.13\
Node version: v14.17.0

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Overview

At the top of the screen, there are input controls for the various props that the list component takes. These will change the props for the list that is rendered below.

Type text into the input provided and press 'Enter' to add the text to the list.

Click the X next to the list items to remove them from the list.
